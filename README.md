Reusable github workflows

This repo is the home of our reusable Github workflows. For each workflow, or set of workflows, we have, there
is a current release branch which will receive non-breaking changes.
For example, the ansible workflows can be found in the
ansible-v1 branch. A breaking change will
mean that we bump the version number at the end of this branch name and will
only continue working on the newer version.
